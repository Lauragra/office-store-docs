# Use the Seller Dashboard to submit your solution to the Office Store

If you want your Office Add-in, Office 365 web app, or Power BI custom visual to appear in the Office Store, you need to submit it to the  [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605) for approval. First,  familiarize yourself with the [Office Store validation policies](validation-policies.md). You can add and save your submission as a draft in your Seller Dashboard account until you're ready to submit it for approval.
 

If your SharePoint Add-in requires an Open Authorization (OAuth) client ID and client secret, you can add a client ID and client secret in the Seller Dashboard before you add your add-in. For more information, see  [Create or update client IDs and secrets in the Seller Dashboard](create-or-update-client-ids-and-secrets.md).
 

If you're submitting Office 365 web apps to the Seller Dashboard, make sure that you have registered your web app with  [Azure Active Directory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually). The Office Store currently accepts only Azure AD apps that use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect as their authentication method.
 

For information about the Office Store approval process, see  [Submit to the Office Store](submit-to-the-office-store.md).
