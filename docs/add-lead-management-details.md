# Add lead management details for your Office Add-ins in the Seller Dashboard

To get information about users who acquire your add-in, you can submit lead configuration details for your customer relationship management (CRM) system in the Seller Dashboard. 

You can use leads to follow up with customers directly to ensure that they have a successful experience with your solution. 

For customers who acquire your add-in via AppSource, the following details are sent to your lead management system:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address

>**Note:** Leads support for acquisitions made via the Office Store and in-client experiences are coming soon.

## Add lead management information to the Seller Dashboard

As part of the submission process, you will be prompted to submit lead configuration details so that you can receive lead information. On the **Lead Management** tab, choose the **I want to receive lead information from users who acquire my add-in** check box, and provide the following information.


|**Field**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Offer Display Name|A title to annotate how the lead was generated. For example, Contoso Business Planner Add-in.|
|Publisher Display Name|A title to represent your publisher information within the lead. For example, Contoso Add-in Development team.|
|Lead Destination|Choose the applicable CRM or storage service from the dropdown.|

The steps to complete your lead submission process will vary based on the CRM system provider that you choose.  

>**Note:** If your CRM system provider is not listed, we recommend that you select Azure Table. Most popular CRM services can integrate with this storage service.
